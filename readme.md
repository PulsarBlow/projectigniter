# Project Igniter
# WORK IN PROGRESS
#### Live demo @ http://projectigniter-demo.azurewebsites.net/

This is a tool created to support the launch of one of my new personnal project.

The idea behind this app is to let our friends and close relatives to provide direct feedback during the project ignition.
Like helping us to choose a cool name, to vote for a logo, to help us to define the v1.0 features roadmap etc...
Each steps of the project will be community driven.

## Allow your friends to be the "product owner"

One of the purpose of this app is to put our friends in the [Product Owner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_Owner) role of a scrum process, in a fun/user-friendly manner.
We can't use any existing scrum tool we know because they aren't made for the average user (sad but true).

## 100% client side code

The other purpose of this app is to evaluate and showcase some development technologies/techniques.

The app is built upon [Angular JS](http://angularjs.org) with a pure realtime (websockets) JSON database ([firebase.io](http://www.firebase.com)).
Everything is written in Javascript, no server side plumbing, except a basic web server to host client files (html/css/js).
Thus this app can be considerated as a pure web client side app.

This app is coded 100% online with [Nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/join/Nx2ZUMqxfNI?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral)
